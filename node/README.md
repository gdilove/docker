# Debian bullseye with Nvm and node 12

## Download nvm from github in the same folder before build.
git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git or
git clone git@github.com:nvm-sh/nvm.git (faster in China) or download zip file.

If you want to install node 14 or 16 by default, please change 12 to 14 or 16 on line 41 in Dockerfile
